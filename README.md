# FirstDX12Renderer
This project wants to mainly showcase two topics:
- Base CMake Project Configuration
  - Part1 and Part2 are target executables. These targets have dependencies on defined target libraries (both internal and external).
  - Part1 has the simplest configuration, while Part2 links against a wider range of libraries.
- DX12-powered Render Window
